# Thermal Faster R-CNN for FIR Pedestrians Detection on SCUT

### Introduction

This code is provided a modified Faster R-CNN for FIR pedestrians detection on SCUT Dataset.

The code RPN in this repo is written based on the MATLAB implementation of RPN+BF. Details about RPN+BF in: [zhangliliang/RPN_BF](https://github.com/zhangliliang/RPN_BF).

The code `external/code3.2.1` and `external/toolbox` is clone from [SCUT-CV/SCUT\_FIR\_Pedestrian\_Dataset](https://github.com/SCUT-CV/SCUT_FIR_Pedestrian_Dataset) which is based on  [Caltech dataset tool](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/) and Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox. Detials about Piotr’s Toolbox are in：[pdollar/toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox).

The SCUT FIR Pedestrians Dataset is a large far infrared pedestrian detection dataset. Detials about SCUT dataset are in: [SCUT-CV](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cv/scut_fir_pedestrian_dataset/).
